# ft_containers

## Description
This project is aimed at mastering the main containers of the STL library, as well as at mastering the basic SFINAE tools in C++98.
Implemented containers:
List, Vector, Map, Queue, Stack

As part of the task, it was not necessary to make your allocator, so it was taken as std::allocator.
std::algorithm does not work with all containers. This is largely due to the implementation of iterators.

P.s. On the website www.cplusplus.com you can find a very important information about containers library STL.
